large smelly orc~
an orc~
A large, smelly orc is wandering around here.
~
Standing almost 6' tall, you'd wager that you can smell him at least
at that distance. As he sees you, there is a glint in his eyes. Perhaps
he sees you as dinner.

orc king bhane~
Bhane~
The Orc King Bhane is standing guard here looking regal.
~
As regal as an orc gets, I guess. Over his armor he wears faded robes
that once perhaps belonged to a nobel or royality. He does not think
much of your intrusion to his domain.
